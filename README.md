# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
A Data Science and Analytics project using Python to analyze Zomato data. Leveraging Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project explores trends in online vs offline delivery, popular restaurant types, and preferred dining price ranges for couples, providing insights through data visualization and analysis.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used:

NumPy â€“ Efficient handling of large numerical computations and array operations.

Pandas â€“ Simplifies data manipulation and analysis with intuitive DataFrames.

Matplotlib â€“ Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.

Seaborn â€“ Built on Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab â€“ For interactive development, visualization, and sharing of results.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:

To derive meaningful insights from Zomato's restaurant data by answering the following questions:

Online vs Offline Delivery â€“ Do a greater number of restaurants offer online delivery compared to offline dining services?

Popular Restaurant Types â€“ Which types of restaurants are most favored by the general public?

Couplesâ€™ Dining Preferences â€“ What price range is preferred by couples for a dinner outing?
